## Overview

AWS was a first generation public cloud platform started in 2006. Its infrastructure services and pay as go pricing model made it an incredibly 
compelling choice for a previous generation of developers. But what about the future? 

M3O is an attempt to build a new cloud platform with simpler higher level building blocks. Micro APIs for the Next generation of developers. 
Consume free and paid public APIs all one one platform for a 10x developer experience.

## Features

M3O is host to 40+ [services](#services) and counting. Below are the platform features:

- **🔥 Dev UX** - The developer experience is first priority. A slick new UX and code generated clients for the next generation of developers.
- **☝️ One Token** - Use one Micro API token to fulfill all your API needs. Access multiple public APIs with a single token.
- **⚡ Fast Access** - Using a new API is easy - no need to learn yet another API, it's all the same Micro developer experience.
- **🆓 Free to start** - It's a simple pay as you grow model and everything is priced per request. Top up your account and start making calls.
- **🚫 Anti AWS Billing** - Don't get lost in a sea of infinite cloud billing. We show you exactly what you use and don't hide any of the costs.
- **✔️ Open Source Software** - Built on an open source foundation and services which anyone can contribute to with a simple PR.

## Rationale

AWS is a fairly complex beast which makes it hard for new developers to get started. In the past we needed VMs and file storage, but today with the Jamstack 
and other modern development tools, the building blocks we're looking for are changing. We're mostly now consuming third party public APIs. M3O wants to aggregate all those APIs onto one platform as simpler programmable building blocks for a 10x developer experience.

## How it Works

Read below to learn more about how it all works

### Infrastructure

M3O is built on existing public cloud infrastructure using managed kubernetes along with our own [infrastructure automation](https://github.com/m3o/platform). 
We host the open source project [Micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) as our base cloud OS and use it to power all the [Micro Services](services).

### Control Plane

We host our own [cloud](https://github.com/m3o/cloud-next) dev UX on top of the infrastructure stack and a [backend](https://github.com/m3o/backend) 
which acts as the management control plane. This productizes the entire offering and allows for publishing of services with configurable pricing.

### Micro Services

Developers build and contribute to [Micro Services](services), which act as an abstraction layer for existing third party 
public APIs. We then automate the building and publishing of those services and generate client libraries for them all. 

## Development

This project is a combination of open source projects and a platform managed by the M3O team. Our goal is to enable any developer to 
contribute to the open source while benefiting from the platform as a shared resource.

### Source

The core services, automation and the backend are all open source:

- [services](services) - offered on the M3O platform
- [platform](https://github.com/m3o/platform) - infrastructure automation
- [backend](https://github.com/m3o/backend) - powering the M3O platform

### Dev UX

We provide the following dev UX for the consumption of Micro services:

- [cloud-next](https://github.com/m3o/cloud-next) - Next.js based Web dashboard which can be self hosted
- [m3o-js](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-js) - JS client library with statically typed interfaces and examples
- [m3o-go](https://github.com/m3o/m3o-go) - Go client library with code generated functions and examples

### Hosting

The cloud hosting providers of Micro services:

- [m3o.com](https://m3o.com) - Micro as a Service

## Publish APIs

If you'd like to publish your own APIs on the M3O platform [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/9SQV6DdLNDzSRQ477) and we'll get back to you.

## Contributing
